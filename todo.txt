1. Evaluators:
	1.1 Center of Mass
	1.2 Connected groups

2. Heuristics:
	a) Kinds:
		* MaxDepth heuristics (utility)
			Weighted sum of evaluators
		* Selective (choice) h to define which node to explore
		
	b)
	
3. Algorithm 
	a)Features:
		* Iterative digging (quiescence search)
		* states dictionary (TranspositionsTable)
	b)
		3.1 Get All successors
		3.2 Sort them by selective heuristics (Node reordering)
		3.3 Save results in TranspositionsTable
		3.4 Calculate QuadValueTableExt (state info, number of connected states, iteratice information using action)
